# 🔢 Digital Root Calculator — C Mini Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project is a **Digital Root Calculator** developed using the C programming language.

The program extracts digits of a number, adds them together,
and repeats this process until a **single digit** remains.

If the sum is greater than 9, the computation continues again.

This project is based on:
- Loop-based digit extraction
- Repeated summation
- Modular arithmetic
- Logical problem solving

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to:

- Take an integer input from the user
- Extract digits using `% 10`
- Add digits using a loop
- If the sum > 9 → repeat process
- Continue until only a single digit remains
- Display the **Digital Root**

---

## ✨ Features
✔ User input support  
✔ Logical & iterative approach  
✔ Repeated digit summation  
✔ Outputs final single-digit result  
✔ Beginner-friendly implementation

## 🧾 Sample Output

Input
```
9875
```

Process
```
9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29
2 + 9 = 11
1 + 1 = 2
```
Final Output
```
Digital Root = 2
```
